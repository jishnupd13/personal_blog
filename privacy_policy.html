    <p style="text-align:center; font-style: italic;">Last updated: 08&nbsp;August&nbsp;2025</p>

    <p>Quotes App ("the App") is developed and maintained by <strong>Jishnu P&nbsp;Dileep</strong> ("we", "our", or "us"). This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information when you use the App.</p>

    <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
    <p>The App is designed to display inspirational quotes. <strong>We do not collect any personally identifiable information</strong> from you. The App does not require you to create an account, sign in, or provide any personal data such as your name, email address, phone number, location, or contacts.</p>

    <h3>2. Non-Personal Data</h3>
    <p>To improve the stability and performance of the App, we may collect anonymous, non-personal data (for example, crash logs and usage statistics) through Google Play-provided services such as <em>Google Play Console</em> and <em>Firebase Crashlytics</em>. This information cannot be used to identify you and is used solely for debugging and analytics purposes.</p>

    <h3>3. Advertising and Third-Party Services</h3>
    <p>The current version of the App <strong>does not display third-party advertisements</strong> and does not integrate any analytics SDKs other than the Google Play services mentioned above. If we introduce ads or additional third-party services in a future update, this privacy policy will be updated accordingly, and you will be notified via the app update notes.</p>

    <h3>4. Children’s Privacy</h3>
    <p>The App is rated "<em>Everyone</em>" on Google Play and does not target children under the age of 13 with content or data-collection practices. Because we do not collect personal data, we comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and relevant Google Play policies.</p>

    <h3>5. Data Security</h3>
    <p>Even though we do not store personal data, we take app security seriously. All network requests (currently limited to fetching quote data, if any) are made over <em>HTTPS</em> to protect the integrity of transmitted content.</p>

    <h3>6. Changes to This Policy</h3>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page and, where appropriate, within the App. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.</p>

    <h3>7. Contact Us</h3>
    <p>If you have any questions or suggestions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:jishnupdileep@gmail.com">jishnupd13@gmail.com</a>.</p>
